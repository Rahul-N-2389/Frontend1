<h3>EDUCATION</h3><hr>
<pre><p>DVR & DR. HS MIC COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY, Kanchikacherla                    2021 to 2025 
    Bachelor of Technology: Electronics and Communication Engineering          7.44 CGPA </p>
</pre>

<h3>PROJECT</h3><hr>
<p><i><b>VLSI ARCHITECTURES FOR SECURITY ANALYSIS WITH DUAL- KEY LFSR USING BARREL SHIFTER AND S-BOX  </b></i></p>
<ul>
    <li>The increasing demand for secure and efficient encryption methods in hardware implementations has led to the 
development of optimized VLSI architectures.</li>
<li>This project presents a novel security framework incorporating a Dual-Key LFSR with a Barrel Shifter and an S-Box for 
enhanced cryptographic performance. </li>
<li>The Dual-Key LFSR enhances randomness and resistance to linear attacks, while the Barrel Shifter accelerates bit-level 
operations, improving overall encryption speed.  </li>
<li>The S-Box adds non-linearity and confusion, strengthening the cryptographic robustness of the system. </li>
